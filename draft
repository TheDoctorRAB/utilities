For those of you that don't know, Marc Skinner is the CEO of the Idaho Falls Center. He's been doing a great job getting us here hooked up with industry. Given the challenges obtaining federal funding relationships with industry are essential for our overall growth. Marc led the effort to get Sakae Casting to establish an office in Idaho Falls, leading to our IGEM grant.

To that end, Apple will be visiting next Wednesday. They've been visiting all the centers. Apple is working with Inspire Idaho and the UI to offer a unique coding training opportunity in 20 communities (many rural) across Idaho. While not research per se, this could lead to bigger efforts. 

There will be three meetings.

Extension—CAES Snake River room, 1:00-2:00
Education—CAES Auditorium, 3:00-4:00
Community Influencers—Snow Eagle Brewing and Grill, 4:30-5:30pm with reception to follow.

Please let Jen Flynn know if you plan to attend any of these. jmflynn@uidaho.edu
